研究课题：差分隐私保护约束下集成分类算法的研究
Research on an Ensemble Classification Algorithm Based on Differential Privacy

Keyword： Privacy protection, differential privacy, machine learning, AdaBoost.

Background：In the field of information security, privacy protection based on machine learning is currently a hot topic. 
For classification issues under privacy protection

CART-DPsAdaboost：We proposes an AdaBoost ensemble classification algorithm based on 
differential privacy protection: CART-DPsAdaBoost (CART-Differential Privacy structure of AdaBoost). 

DataSet：Adult、Census Income from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Experimental Result：Adult and Census Income show that the model has good classification accuracy while taking into account privacy and usability.
